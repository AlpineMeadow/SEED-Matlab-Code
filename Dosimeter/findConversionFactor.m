function newChannel1CountsToRads = findConversionFactor(countDifferenceChannel1, info)


%I am now being asked to do something that I only marginally understand.
%According to my understanding, the count values in the rawDose channels
%will always increase except for two reasons.  The first is when the
%instrument resets every 20 minutes.  Then the counts are set to zero
%(except for channel 1, which is apparently set to an arbitrary value.
% The second reason is that the counters can overflow.  Richard said
%that the counters are 12-bit counters which means they can record up to
%4096 counts.  But he also tells me that I should not worry about 4096 as
%that is somehow not important.  Apparently what happens is that the ADC
%allows a factor of 4 larger then 4096 so counts can legitimately get up to
%16384 before it rolls over.
%In any event I am supposed to subtract the (average highest count
%before rollover) â€“ (average lowest count after rollover).  This is not to 
%be done for the 20 minute reset events but only for the rollover events.
%This procedure yields the delta counts corresponding to 3.6 mRad and that 
%will be the case even during 20 min cycles when it doesn't roll over 
%The problem is distinguishing between rollovers due to high count values
%and resets due to the 20 minute reset events since the way I am finding
%events like this is to look at the results of differencing each value.
%When the diff value is negative then we have had either a rollover or a
%reset event.  The way to do this is to find the counts around -8900 which
%cause a rollover.  The mean of the distribution of those counts gives the
%value around which to calculate the calibration factor.

%This function is called by getDosimeterDose.m.


%First find the indices where the count difference goes negative.
rolloverPlusResetIndex = find(countDifferenceChannel1 < 0);

%Find the indices from the rollover index that correspond to rollover events
%as compared to the reset events.
%rolloverIndex = find(countDifferenceChannel1(rolloverPlusResetIndex) < info.minimumDiffValue);
rolloverIndex = find(countDifferenceChannel1(rolloverPlusResetIndex) < 1);
%Now just create a new index that contains the points that are believed to
%be rollover events.
validRolloverIndex = rolloverPlusResetIndex(rolloverIndex);
