This directory contains the matlab code used to read SEED and Dosimeter netcdf data
files that were generated by the matlab script named LosAlamosGetSEEDDosimeterData.m

The driver program is : LosAlamosCheckNetcdf.m
I have written this two different ways. The first is that I have named all of the
function below with the number 1 appended onto the end and then appended those
functions onto the end of the driver program. This was so that only one single file
had to be passed around to Geoff and possibly the Los Alamos people.  So the first
version of this driver program is completely self-contained.  The second way is that
I separated out the different functions and renamed them without the number 1.  The
listing below is for those functions.


1.  genLosAlamosInfo.m -> This function generates the information structure.

2.  LosAlamosGetNetcdfData.m  -> This function gets the netcdf data as generated by
the LosAlamosGetSEEDDosimeterData.m.

3. makeLosAlamosSpectra.m  -> This function plots an energy-time spectrogram.

4.  plotLosAlamosDosimter.m ->  This function plots generates a summary plot of the
dosimeter.
