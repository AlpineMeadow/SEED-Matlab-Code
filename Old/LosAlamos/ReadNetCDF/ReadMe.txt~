This directory contains the matlab code used to read SEED and Dosimeter netcdf data
files that were generated by the matlab script named LosAlamosGetSEEDDosimeterData.m

The driver program is : LosAlamosCheckNetcdf.m

1.  genLosAlamosInfo.m -> This function generates the information structure.

2.  LosAlamosGetNetcdfData.m  -> This function gets the netcdf data as generated by
the LosAlamosGetSEEDDosimeterData.m.

3. makeLosAlamosSpectra.m  -> This function plots an energy-time spectrogram.

4.  plotLosAlamosDosimter.m ->  This function plots generates a summary plot of the
dosimeter.
